# Remarque

## Problem
We often see low adoption of Remarketing Campaigns (ACe) among Google Ads
customers

## Solution
The solution provides means for clients to create user segments at any stage of
their funnel, equally split them into test and control groups, conduct
experiments (that is run campaigns with customer match audience of test users)
and analyse any possible gain (hopefully) by comparing conversions from test and
control groups.
